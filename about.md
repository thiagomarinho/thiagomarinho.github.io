Hi! I'm Thiago. I have +9 years of experience working with software development, the past 4 years as a Solution Architect at Dataprev (a government company that works with brazilian people data, public services, huge country-wide integration, etc.), where I work since 2013. I like to think about how can I make life easier with existing applications and/or creating new ones.

I have experience developing, debugging and troubleshooting Java EE (specially service and message oriented) applications and (in my spare time) Ruby/Rails and Javascript applications. I also worked building Puppet Roles, Profiles and custom modules at Dataprev and for personal purposes. My main PHP experience came from my first job.
