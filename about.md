Hello! I have 13+ years of experience working with software development. I work at Thoughtworks as a Platform Engineer, helping teams to get the resources they need to publish their applications and bring value to their customers and company.

I have experience with Terraform, Puppet, Ansible and some experience with Kubernetes, provisioning VMs and kubernetes clusters in cloud providers like Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Cloud Platform and AWS.

I also have experience developing, debugging and troubleshooting Java EE (specially service and message oriented), Ruby/Rails, Javascript and PHP applications.

I like to write tools to help day to day activities, and have a special care for DSL and ways to model knowledge.
