Hi! I'm Thiago. I have 10 years of experience working with software development, the past 4 years as a Software Architect at Dataprev (a government company that works with brazilian people data, public services, huge country-wide integration, etc.), where I work since 2013. I like to think about how can I make life easier with existing applications and/or creating new ones.

I have experience developing, debugging and troubleshooting Java EE (specially service and message oriented) applications and (in my spare time) Ruby/Rails, Javascript and PHP applications.

I also have experience with Puppet, Terraform and I know "a little" Kubernetes, provisioning VMs and kubernetes clusters/containers in cloud providers like Digital Ocean and Google Cloud Platform (GKE).
